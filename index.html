                <br>
                <p>RIT is the home of the ecosystem’s builds and products.</p>
                <p>It represents the foundational core of Ritez Group's analytics-driven technology strategy, and its portfolio includes active builds, launched products, and wholly-owned companies. To support these efforts, RIT works to identify and retain top talent, create systems that align incentives against results, and fill skills and talent gaps for our hosted builds and products.</p>
                <h3>CHANGE AT SCALE</h3>
                <p>We want to identify, invest in, and invent multi-generation platforms that can grow to billions of users and transform whole arenas of economic life.</p>
                <h3>TRANSFORMING INDUSTRIES </h3>
                <p>We aim to change systems, and we work in areas in which the raw material of talent and technology can yield breakthroughs and ubiquity. Sometimes we invest, often we build; if we build, we only back projects we believe will achieve global scale.</p>
                <h3>TECHNOLOGIES (RIT)</h3>
                <p>The foundational core of Ritez Group. We are an engine for repeatable innovation, building sustainable businesses with product-market fit.</p>
                <h3>FOUNDATION</h3>
                <p>Wedding talent and output by accelerating ideas through funding and connections with industry experts, investors, and entrepreneurs.</p>
                <h3>INVESTMENTS</h3>
                <p>Raising capital and investment for companies with the potential to transform industries. We advise portfolio companies on a technical and traditional level.</p>
                <h3>TALENT FIRST</h3>
                <p>We make a few, high-conviction bets, and in doing so, we’re defined as much by what we avoid as what we pursue. We are not searching for quick-wins, and we’re allergic to short-termism. To propel that orientation, we align incentives for both talent and investors to yield returns over the long haul. We are as selective about our partners as we are about the fields we focus on.</p>
                <p>Our focus on systems and platform creation is largely sector and tech agnostic—we might sense a pathbreaking opportunity just as clearly in space exploration as in synthetic biology.</p>
                <p>The common features are promising underlying technology, a multi-decade time horizon, unfulfilled potential, and the ability to reach planet-level scale. Those are the hallmarks of history’s great platform firms, and those are the opportunities we seek.</p>
                <h3>SALARY RANGES.</h3>
                <p>Ritez Group strives to offer competitive salaries in accordance to fairness and market competitiveness. Our compensation structure takes into consideration cost of living and market rates in various regions combined with the individual’s experience, skills and expertise.</p>
                <p>At Ritez Group, we are committed to building a team that reflects the diverse world in which we live. Our goal is to create a culture of empowerment and passion that sets a new standard for mixed reality today. We believe that diversity and inclusivity are essential to achieving this goal, and we are proud to be an equal opportunity employer.</p>
                <p>We welcome qualified applicants of all backgrounds, without regard to race, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, genetic information, national origin, age, disability, medical condition, religion, marital status, veteran status, or any other legally protected status.</p>
